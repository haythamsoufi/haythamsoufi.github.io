# About Me

I'm a passionate developer and designer with experience in data collection systems, full-stack development, and UI/UX design. I love building solutions that make a difference and am always eager to learn new technologies and tackle challenging problems.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, or working on creative side projects. I believe in continuous learning and the power of "vibe coding" - building with passion and creativity.

## What I Do

- ✨ Full-stack development
- 🎨 UI/UX Design
- 📊 Data collection & analysis
- 🚀 Open-source contributions
- ✍️ Technical writing
