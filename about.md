## What Drives Me

I believe in the power of data to drive positive change, especially in humanitarian contexts. My journey from mechanical engineering through humanitarian work to data systems has given me a unique perspective on how technology can serve human needs. I'm passionate about creating clear, actionable insights from complex information and supporting organizations that make a real difference in people's lives.

When I'm not working with data, you can find me exploring new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, or working on creative side projects. I believe in continuous learning and the power of combining technical expertise with humanitarian impact.
