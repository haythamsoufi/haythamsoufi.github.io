- **Recommended size**: 1920x1200px (16:10 aspect ratio)
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:10 (will be displayed in laptop mockup frame)
- **Quality**: High-resolution screenshots that clearly demonstrate the feature

## Image Reuse

Note that some images are reused across multiple screens within the same section:

- **backoffice.jpg** is used for: Dashboard, User Management, Plugins System, Entities & Data Governance
- **public-website.jpg** is used for: Main Website, Indicator Bank, Resources Library, API Builder
- **mobile-app.jpg** is used for all mobile app screens
- **analytics.jpg** is used for: Analytics (backoffice) and Data Visualization (website)
- **form-builder.jpg** is used specifically for the Form Builder screen
- **multi-language.jpg** is used specifically for Multi-Language Support

This is intentional - each section can showcase different aspects of the same interface through different screens with descriptive text.

## Notes

- The images will automatically display in their respective mockup frames (laptop or phone)
- If an image is missing, a placeholder will be shown instead
- All images should be high-quality screenshots that clearly demonstrate the feature or interface
- Screenshots should be representative of the actual application interface
- Consider using consistent styling and themes across screenshots for better visual coherence
