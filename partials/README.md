# Partials Folder

This folder contains HTML partials/components for a modular build system.

## Status: Active

The partials system is now active. Sections are loaded dynamically from partial files into `index.html` using JavaScript fetch.

## How It Works

Partials are loaded on page load using JavaScript:
- `project-details.html` - Loaded into `#project-details-container`
- `contact.html` - Loaded into `#contact-container`

## Benefits

- Modular code organization
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Reusable components
- Cleaner main HTML file

## Files

- `background.html` - Animated background component
- `navigation.html` - Navigation menu
- `hero.html` - Hero section
- `project-details.html` - Project details section
- `about.html` - About section
- `skills.html` - Skills section
- `projects.html` - Projects section
- `contact.html` - Contact section
- `mockup-modal.html` - Fullscreen mockup modal
